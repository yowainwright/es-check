# Polyfill Detection

ES Check can help identify when polyfills are needed and detect if they're already present in your code.

## Using checkForPolyfills Option

The `--checkForPolyfills` flag helps identify polyfilled features that might mask ES version incompatibilities:

```bash
es-check es5 './dist/**/*.js' --checkForPolyfills
```

## How It Works

When enabled, ES Check will:

1. Detect common polyfill patterns
2. Warn about polyfilled features that exceed your target ES version
3. Help ensure your code works without polyfills in target environments

## Example

```bash
# Without polyfill detection
es-check es5 './dist/app.js'
# ✓ Passed (but might include polyfills)

# With polyfill detection
es-check es5 './dist/app.js' --checkForPolyfills
# ⚠ Warning: Array.prototype.includes polyfilled (ES7 feature)
```

## Common Polyfills Detected

- Array methods (includes, find, findIndex)
- Object methods (assign, entries, values)
- String methods (startsWith, endsWith, includes)
- Promise
- Symbol
- Map/Set

## Configuration

In `.escheckrc`:

```json
{
  "ecmaVersion": "es5",
  "files": "./dist/**/*.js",
  "checkForPolyfills": true
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test without polyfills**: Ensure your code works in target environments
2. **Document polyfill requirements**: List required polyfills in your README
3. **Use targeted polyfills**: Only include polyfills for features you actually use
4. **Consider polyfill services**: Use services like polyfill.io for dynamic polyfilling
