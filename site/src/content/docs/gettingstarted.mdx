# Getting Started with ES Check

**ES Check** checks JavaScript files against a specified version of ECMAScript (ES) with a shell command. If a specified file's ES version doesn't match the ES version argument passed in the ES Check command, ES Check will throw an error and log the files that didn't match the check.

## Why ES Check?

In modern JavaScript builds, files are bundled up so they can be served in an optimized manner in the browsers. It is assumed by developers that future JavaScript—like ES8 will be transpiled (changed from future JavaScript to current JavaScript) appropriately by a tool like Babel. Sometimes there is an issue where files are not transpiled. There was no efficient way to test for files that weren't transpiled—until now. That's what ES Check does.

## Installation

Install ES Check locally or globally:

```bash
npm i es-check --save-dev   # locally
npm i es-check -g           # or globally
```

## Quick Start

Check if an array or glob of files matches a specified ES version:

```bash
es-check es5 './vendor/js/*.js' './dist/**/*.js'
```

The ES Check script above checks `/dist/*.js` files to see if they're ES5. It throws an error and logs files that do not pass the check.

## Basic Usage

ES Check is a shell command CLI that takes in two arguments: an ECMAScript version and files in globs.

```bash
# Check single directory
es-check es6 ./js/*.js

# Check multiple directories
es-check es6 ./js/*.js ./dist/*.js
```

## ES Versions Supported

ES Check supports the following ECMAScript versions:

- es3
- es4
- es5
- es6/es2015
- es7/es2016
- es8/es2017
- es9/es2018
- es10/es2019
- es11/es2020
- es12/es2021
- es13/es2022
- es14/es2023

## Configuration File

For consistent configuration, create a `.escheckrc` file in JSON format:

```json
{
  "ecmaVersion": "es6",
  "module": false,
  "files": "./dist/**/*.js",
  "not": ["./dist/skip/*.js"],
  "checkFeatures": true
}
```

Then run ES Check without arguments:

```bash
es-check
```
